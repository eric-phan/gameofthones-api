<h1 align="center">Game of Thrones API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built Game of Thrones API containing information of your favorite houses.</h3>



### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###
#### Some Notes:
- All of the great houses are included in the API.
- I want to maintain and add more of the lesser houses to the API when I can.
- I highly recommend watching the inital season of GoT or even thee prequel, House of the Dragon! Have fun!


#### Tech Stuff:
- This API was created using Node.js an Express.
- This is my first dedicated app that I built a backend for, and it has definitely been a rigorous learning experience that I enjoyed. I am excited to delve deeper into these tech stacks.



#### Future Improvements:
- Increasing the API size to include minor houses.
- Including documentation so others may use the API more easily.
- Import the data to MongoDB.

### :star: Try it Out

- API is live at: [Heroku API Page](https://got-house-emblems.herokuapp.com/)
